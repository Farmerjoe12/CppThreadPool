# CppThreadPool

This repository is home to a Thread Pool project written in C++.

# Purpose and Intent

With the mass popularization and increased utilization of multi-core processors, serial programming is going to be forced to resign in favor of parallel and concurrent programming. I believe thread pools are an introduction into that parallel computing paradigm, and with that also believe that thread pools bring a significant advantage to the table in terms of high performance computing.

# Plans and Goals

I intend to develop a working, thread-safe, thread pool, which is able to create, populate, and distribute jobs among threads to be completed in a generic way. That is to say this implementation will for all intents and purposes be developed in a manner that will promote platform and machine independence. In a world of proprietary software, the only way to move forward is with unification and open source. As a programmer it's my responsibilty to promote the paradigms I believe in, and will to the best of my abilities serve to further those movements.

# Reason for using github

I am making use of github's distributed development service as a backup to my local files, as well as utilizing the cloud for development across machines for convenience to the developer(myself). Also, should I decide to invite other developers into the project, github is the most popular version control system as of 2017.
